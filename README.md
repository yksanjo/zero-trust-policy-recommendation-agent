# zero-trust-policy-recommendation-agent

## Detailed Description

zero-trust-policy-recommendation-agent is a security-focused project that evaluates risk signals, policy violations, and suspicious activity for faster incident response.  
This repository now includes a runnable baseline implementation, tests, and architecture documentation for production-oriented development.

## Problem Statement

Teams need fast, deterministic signals to prioritize work and reduce operational risk.

## Solution Overview

This project ingests runtime signals, computes a deterministic score, and emits structured results for downstream workflows.
